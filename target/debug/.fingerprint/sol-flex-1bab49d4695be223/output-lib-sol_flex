Example:\n\n```\nuse self::something::Foo; // Ok.\n\nmod something {\n    pub struct Foo;\n}\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nIf you tried to use a module from an external crate and are using Rust 2015,\nyou may have missed the `extern crate` declaration (which is usually placed in\nthe crate root):\n\n```edition2015\nextern crate core; // Required to use the `core` crate in Rust 2015.\n\nuse core::any;\n# fn main() {}\n```\n\nSince Rust 2018 the `extern crate` declaration is not required and\nyou can instead just `use` it:\n\n```edition2018\nuse core::any; // No extern crate required in Rust 2018.\n# fn main() {}\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/instructions/jupiter_swap.rs","byte_start":33,"byte_end":43,"line_start":2,"line_end":2,"column_start":5,"column_end":15,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount, Transfer};","highlight_start":5,"highlight_end":15}],"label":"use of unresolved module or unlinked crate `anchor_spl`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"if you wanted to use a crate named `anchor_spl`, use `cargo add anchor_spl` to add it to your `Cargo.toml`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0432]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: unresolved import `anchor_spl`\u001b[0m\n \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/instructions/jupiter_swap.rs:2:5\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m2\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount, Transfer};\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91muse of unresolved module or unlinked crate `anchor_spl`\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m: if you wanted to use a crate named `anchor_spl`, use `cargo add anchor_spl` to add it to your `Cargo.toml`\n\n"}

Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/instructions/set_distribution_config.rs","byte_start":996,"byte_end":1026,"line_start":40,"line_end":40,"column_start":21,"column_end":51,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub

Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/lib.rs","byte_start":1980,"byte_end":1983,"line_start":56,"line_end":56,"column_start":56,"column_end":59,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        instructions::set_distribution_config::handler(ctx, params)","highlight_start":56,"highlight_end":59}],"label":"unsatisfied trait bound","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the trait `Bumps` is not implemented for `set_distribution_config::SetDistributionConfig<'_>`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/instructions/set_distribution_config.rs","byte_start":458,"byte_end":497,"line_start":18,"line_end":18,"column_start":1,"column_end":40,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub struct SetDistributionConfig<'info> {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":40}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"the following other types implement trait `Bumps`:\n  CreateNonceAccount<'info>\n  CreateNonceAccountWithSeed<'info>\n  __idl::IdlAccounts<'info>\n  __idl::IdlCloseAccount<'info>\n  __idl::IdlCreateAccounts<'info>\n  __idl::IdlCreateBuffer<'info>\n  __idl::IdlResizeAccount<'info>\n  __idl::IdlSetBuffer<'info>\nand 23 others","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"required by a bound in `anchor_lang::context::Context`","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/var/folders/dh/k33wsr015_b6pk5c26c07prw0000gn/T/cursor-sandbox-cache/23883511981866bbacb8d6c0a0f26f13/cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/anchor-lang-0.29.0/src/context.rs","byte_start":826,"byte_end":831,"line_start":24,"line_end":24,"column_start":42,"column_end":47,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"pub struct Context<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T: Bumps> {","highlight_start":42,"highlight_end":47}],"label":"required by this bound in `Context`","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0277]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: the trait bound `set_distribution_config::SetDistributionConfig<'_>: Bumps` is not satisfied\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/lib.rs:56:56\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m56\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         instructions::set_distribution_config::handler(ctx, params)\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                                        \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91munsatisfied trait bound\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: the trait `Bumps` is not implemented for `set_distribution_config::SetDistributionConfig<'_>`\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/instructions/set_distribution_config.rs:18:1\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m18\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m pub struct SetDistributionConfig<'info> {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1mhelp\u001b[0m: the following other types implement trait `Bumps`:\n             CreateNonceAccount<'info>\n             CreateNonceAccountWithSeed<'info>\n             __idl::IdlAccounts<'info>\n             __idl::IdlCloseAccount<'info>\n             __idl::IdlCreateAccounts<'info>\n             __idl::IdlCreateBuffer<'info>\n             __idl::IdlResizeAccount<'info>\n             __idl::IdlSetBuffer<'info>\n           and 23 others\n\u001b[1m\u001b[92mnote\u001b[0m: required by a bound in `anchor_lang::context::Context`\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0m/var/folders/dh/k33wsr015_b6pk5c26c07prw0000gn/T/cursor-sandbox-cache/23883511981866bbacb8d6c0a0f26f13/cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/anchor-lang-0.29.0/src/context.rs:24:42\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m24\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m pub struct Context<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T: Bumps> {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                          \u001b[1m\u001b[92m^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[92mrequired by this bound in `Context`\u001b[0m\n\n"}
